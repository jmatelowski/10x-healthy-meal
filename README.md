## Project Description

HealthyMeal addresses the common challenge of adjusting publicly available recipes to fit dietary restrictions such as vegetarianism, veganism, gluten-free diets, diabetes, nut allergies or low-FODMAP requirements. Instead of manually searching for substitutions, users can store recipes in the app and let an AI model instantly propose ingredient and step changes that match their saved dietary preferences.

## Project Scope

HealthyMeal MVP delivers the following core capabilities (see PRD ¬ß3 ‚ÄúWymagania funkcjonalne‚Äù):

Key features:

- **User accounts** ‚Äì registration, login and permanent deletion of profile & recipes.
- **Dietary profile** ‚Äì multi-select of predefined preferences (6 options). Changes take effect immediately.
- **Recipe management** ‚Äì add, edit, view and hard-delete up to 10 000-character recipes with title ‚â§ 50 characters.
- **AI integration** ‚Äì send a recipe to a AI model, receive an adapted version, accept to save or reject to discard.
- **Analytics** ‚Äì `recipe_saved` event timestamped only on first creation.

The MVP purposefully leaves out advanced features such as multimedia, URL import, social sharing, encryption at rest and WCAG compliance.
